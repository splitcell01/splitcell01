# Hi, I'm Cole!

I’m a software engineer focused on **distributed systems**, **networking**, and **backend infrastructure**.  
I love building real systems — Go services, networked applications, homelab deployments, and cloud-native tooling.  
I’m especially interested in Internet performance, secure communication, and low-level protocols.

## Technical Focus

**Languages:** Go, Python, Java, C, C++, SQL  
**Systems & Networking:** TCP/IP, DNS, WebSockets, TLS, concurrency, sockets  
**Infrastructure:** Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana, Terraform  
**DevOps & Cloud:** Linux, VPS hosting, firewall/routing config, observability, CI/CD
