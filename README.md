# Hi, I'm Cole!

I'm a software engineer who enjoys building backend systems and anything that touches networks or distributed behavior. Most of my learning comes from making real things work: Go services, networked apps, self-hosted infrastructure, and small systems that help me understand how everything fits together. I like digging into how data moves around, why protocols behave the way they do, and how to make services more reliable.
