# Hi, I'm Cole!

I build things that move data around: backend services, networking tools, and small distributed systems that help me understand how real infrastructure works. I love figuring out why systems behave the way they do and making them a little faster, more reliable, or more interesting.

## 🧠 What I Like Working On

**Languages:** Go, Python, Java, C, C++  
**Systems:** concurrency, networking protocols, WebSockets, DNS, TLS  
**Infra:** Docker, Kubernetes (learning), Linux, observability  
**DevOps:** CI/CD, VPS hosting, reverse proxies, monitoring stacks

## 🏗️ Projects I’m Proud Of

### **Secure Messenger — Go backend + desktop client**  
A real-time messaging system with WebSockets, presence, and structured logging.

- Concurrency-safe message handling in Go  
- JWT auth + TLS termination  
- Docker Compose deployment  
- PostgreSQL storage + logging  
- JavaFX desktop UI  

---

### **DNS Server — Python**  
A from-scratch DNS server to better understand low-level networking.

- Raw socket parsing + response construction  
- Concurrent request handling  
- Basic caching + instrumentation  

---

### **Image Processing Server — C + TCP**  
A client–server app for transferring images and rotating them via a custom protocol.

- Multi-threaded request handling  
- Binary protocol over TCP  
- File transfer + processing pipeline  

---

### **Homelab Infrastructure — Docker + Linux**  
My playground for learning real ops work.

- Monitoring stack, media stack, VPN, routing experiments  
- Automated configs and backups  
- A place to test deployments, service reliability, and networking ideas

## 🎓 About Me

- CS degree from the University of Minnesota  
- Curious about distributed systems, backend engineering, and networking  
- Trying to understand things the way Cloudflare, Netflix, and large-scale systems engineers do
