# Hi, I'm Cole!

I'm a software engineer interested in backend systems, distributed computing, and networking.
I like building real, working systems — Go services, networked applications, homelab setups, 
and cloud-deployed infrastructure. I learn best by creating projects that explore how 
concurrency, communication, and protocol design work under the hood.
